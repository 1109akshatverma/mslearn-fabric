# How to use Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

This lab provides an introduction to Dataflows (Gen2) and Data Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric, focusing on their role in data ingestion, transformation, and automation. Participants will explore how Dataflows (Gen2) connect to various data sources, perform transformations using Power Query Online, and integrate with Data Pipelines to load data into a lakehouse or analytical store. The lab will also cover building and orchestrating pipelines using the Fabric user interface, enabling automation of extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes without extensive coding.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Analyze data with Apache Spark** : You will learn how to use Apache Spark within Microsoft Fabric to explore and analyze large datasets. This task will guide you through creating Spark notebooks, running distributed data processing tasks, and performing data transformations to gain meaningful insights.

- **Create a Dataflow (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric** : You will learn how to create and configure Dataflows (Gen2) to connect to data sources and perform transformations using Power Query Online. This task introduces the core features of Dataflows and demonstrates how they can be used in pipelines or Power BI datasets.

- **Ingest data with a pipeline**: You will learn how to build data pipelines to ingest data from external sources into a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric. This includes using Apache Spark to apply custom transformations before loading the data for analysis.

## Pre-requisites

- Foundational understanding of Microsoft Fabric and its core components
- Familiarity with data ingestion and transformation concepts
- Basic knowledge of Power Query and its role in data preparation

## Architecture

The architecture of this lab revolves around Microsoft Fabric’s Dataflows (Gen2) and Data Pipelines, forming a seamless framework for data ingestion, transformation, and automation. Dataflows (Gen2) serve as the entry point, connecting to diverse data sources and leveraging Power Query Online for data transformation. These transformed datasets integrate with Data Pipelines, which orchestrate data movement into a lakehouse or analytical store. The Fabric user interface facilitates pipeline construction and automation, streamlining extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflows without requiring extensive coding, thereby enhancing efficiency and scalability in data processing.
