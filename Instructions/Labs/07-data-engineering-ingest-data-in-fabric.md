# Data Engineering Ingest Data in Fabric

 In the labs you'll create a simple data pipeline to bring in customer sales data. You are using the KiZAN Fabric Tenant - where we have Copilot enabled, demonstrate doing the same thing, but by using a new Data Flow Gen2 And leveraging the native integration of Copilot to use natural language to ingest and transform your data.
 
# Create New - Dataflow Gen2

1. In the home page for your workspace, select **New Dataflow Gen2**. After a few seconds, the Power Query editor for your new dataflow opens as shown here.

1. Select **Import from a Text/CSV file**, and create a new data source with the following settings:

    - **Create new connection**
    - **Link to file**: *Selected*
    - **File path or URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/main/sales.csv`
    - **Connection**: Create new connection
    - **data gateway**: (none)
    - **Authentication kind**: Basic
    - Click on **Create**.

1. Click **Copilot** button on Ribbon. 

1. To better illustrate all that Copilot is doing for you, let me expand the UI a little to see what's going on behind the scenes.

1. Expand **Query Settings** (these are the steps in the query that bring in the data)

1. **View menu** : Look for the option or menu labeled "View" in the toolbar or menu bar. Click on it to reveal a dropdown menu.

1. **Diagram View** : From the dropdown menu, select "Diagram View." This will switch your view to a visual representation of your code.

1. **Script View** : Once you're in Script View, you should be able to see the M-Code that Copilot has generated. This is the underlying code representation of the actions or commands depicted in the Diagram View.

1. Looking at the dataâ€¦ Notice the Item Column.

1. This is really three different fields -- It contains a short description of the item, a color and a size.

1.	The fields are not consistently delimited (' ' and then ' ,')

1. Lets use Copilot to clean this up:

    ```
   	Add a step to the query
    ```
1. Type the following into Copilot:
 
    ```
    In the Item column, replace the ',' with ' '
    ```
 
1. The Item column now consistently has a delimiter of ' ' .

1. Show the m-code and new query step that copilot generated.
 
   ```
   Add a step to the query
   ```

1. Type the following into Copilot:
 
    ```
    Split the Item column on the ' ', creating three new fields called Description, Color and Size
    ```
 
1. Three new fields are now created to replace the Item Column
 
1. Show the m-code and new query step that copilot generated
 
   >**Note:** Copilot can do more than transform the table, we can actually change data as well.

1. Scenario: think Red bikes are going to be a big seller, so increase the quantity in Inventory
Call out that the quantities for all items are 1.
 
1. Add a step to the query

1. Type the following into Copilot:
 
    ```
    Multiply the column Quantity by 10 where Color is 'Red'
    ```
 
1. Show that the quantity field for Red bikes is now 10 instead of 1.
 
1.	Discuss the effects in the Visual Query and M-Query/M-Code script.
