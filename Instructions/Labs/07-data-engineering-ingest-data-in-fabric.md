# Exercise 6: Data Engineering Ingest Data in Fabric with Fabric Copilot

 In the labs, you'll create a simple data pipeline to bring in customer sales data. You are using the KiZAN Fabric Tenant - where we have Copilot enabled, demonstrate doing the same thing, but by using a new Data Flow Gen2 And leveraging the native integration of Copilot to use natural language to ingest and transform your data.
 
# Create New - Dataflow Gen2

1. Select the workspace **fabric-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** (this is the workspace that mimics the lab environment)

1. Select **Data Factory** Object in the workspace.

1. In the home page for your workspace, select **New Dataflow Gen2**.

1. After a few seconds, the Power Query editor for your new dataflow opens as shown here.

1. Select **Import from a Text/CSV file**, and create a new data source with the following settings:

    - **Create new connection**
    - **Link to file**: *Selected*
    - **File path or URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/main/sales.csv`
    - **Connection**: Create new connection
    - **data gateway**: (none)
    - **Authentication kind**: Anonymous
    - Click on **Next**.

1. On **Preview file data** page, Click on **Create**.

1. Click **Copilot** button on Ribbon.

1. To better illustrate all that Copilot is doing for you, let me expand the UI a little to see what's going on behind the scenes.

1. Expand **Query Settings** (these are the steps in the query that bring in the data)

1. **View menu**: Look for the option or menu labeled "View" in the toolbar or menu bar. Click on it to reveal a dropdown menu.

1. **Diagram View**: From the dropdown menu, select "Diagram View." This will switch your view to a visual representation of your code.

1. **Script View**: Once you're in Script View, you should be able to see the M-Code that Copilot has generated. This is the underlying code representation of the actions or commands depicted in the Diagram View.

1. Looking at the dataâ€¦ Notice the Item Column.

1. This is really three different fields -- It contains a short description of the item, a color and a size.

1.	The fields are not consistently delimited (' ' and then ',')

1. Let's use Copilot to clean this up:

    ```
   	Add a step that
    ```
    ![New dataflow.](./Images/3.png)

1. Type the following into Copilot:
 
    ```
    In the Item column, remove the ','
    ```
 
1. The Item column now consistently has a delimiter of **' '**.

1. Show the m-code and new query step that the copilot generated.
 
   ```
   Add a step that
   ```
   ![New dataflow.](./Images/3.png)

1. Type the following into Copilot:
 
    ```
    Split the Item column on the ' ', creating three new fields called Description, Color and Size
    ```
 
1. Three new fields are now created to replace the Item Column.

1. Show the m-code and new query step that the copilot generated
 
   >**Note:** Copilot can do more than transform the table, we can actually change data as well.

1. Scenario: think Red bikes are going to be a big seller, so increase the quantity in Inventory
Call out that the quantities for all items are 1.
 
1. Add a step to the query:

   ```
   Add a step that
   ```
   ![New dataflow.](./Images/3.png)

1. Type the following into Copilot:
 
    ```
    Multiply the Quantity column by 10 for all rows where the Color column equals 'Red'. Make sure that the Color column is treated as text and the Quantity column as a number.
    ```
 
1. Show that the quantity field for Red bikes is now 10 instead of 1.

1. Here is a concise summary highlighting the impacts of Visual Query and M-Query/M-Code scripting:

1. Close the Report.

1. **Visual Query**:
   - **Streamlines data exploration**: Visual Query tools offer intuitive interfaces, enabling users to interact with data visually, and facilitating quicker insights without extensive coding.
   - **Enhances accessibility**: With Visual Query, users with varying technical expertise can extract insights from data, reducing reliance on specialized programming skills and promoting broader data utilization across teams.

2. **M-Query/M-Code scripting**:
   - **Enables advanced data manipulation**: M-Query/M-Code scripting provides a robust framework for performing intricate data transformations and analysis, empowering users to tailor processes to specific requirements beyond the capabilities of visual tools.
   - **Facilitates automation and customization**: Through M-Query/M-Code scripting, users can automate repetitive tasks, build custom functions, and create tailored solutions, increasing efficiency and flexibility in data workflows.
